## HCW23
### About
This is my third control homework in the second module of study.
The program reads file which has definite structure with dataset about Moscow's polyclinics.
### Actions
Program can filter data for 2 parameters. It also can sort polyclinics in alphabetical and reversed alphabetical order.
### After
Program saves changed data to file, which is inputed by user. There are 3 modes of saving: to new file; rewriting existed file and adding to existed file.
